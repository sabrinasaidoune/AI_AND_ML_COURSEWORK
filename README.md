Task

A dataset of brain MRI images is on the HPC appbio partition ( /scratch/grp/msc_appbio/AI/Assessment/AD/). 
The data has three classes of images 
•	NoImpairment - MRI images of subjects with no signs of dementia.
•	MildImpairment - MRI images of subjects with mild symptoms of dementia.
•	ModerateImpairment - MRI images of subjects with moderate dementia. 
Use the provided dataset to develop a machine learning model that predicts the disease status of an image.
Apply your knowledge from previous workshops to design, implement, and evaluate the model. Present your results as a short research report, structured like a scientific article. Integrate your findings with relevant literature and discuss the utility and ethics of using the model in a clinical setting.
